# DDN Sandbox
This sandbox is a demo instance of a Hasura Cloud DDN supergraph, used for testing purposes and proofs of concept. 
A few sources are connected to it:
  - Postgres DB hosting the Chinook sample dataset
  - MongoDB Atlas cluster hosting the sample_mflix dataset
  - Sample Snowflake dataset
  - Custom business logic as Typescript functions

Simple JWT based auth is also setup.
